# About me
I am currently pursuing an MSc (thesis-based) in Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary, with a full funding award. In addition to my studies, I serve as a graduate teaching (seasonal) and research assistant (current) at the university. I taught remote sensing courses lab to undergraduate students in the Department of Geomatics Engineering, and now working as a graduate research assistant in the Earth Observation for Environment Laboratory.

My research focuses on early forest fire monitoring using active fire data in Canada, particularly in Alberta and the Northwest Territories. My areas of interest include geospatial analysis related to natural hazards, forest fires, weather and climate, and urban heat islands (UHI), utilizing GIS and remote sensing (RS) technology. I have published several research articles in notable journals such as Nature, Sustainable Cities and Societies, International Journal of Climatology, and Fire Journal.

I am proficient in various software and programming tools, including Python, Google Earth Engine, MATLAB, ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ERDAS Imagine, and ENVI. My long-term goal is to specialize in natural hazards, particularly forest fires, leveraging satellite-based remote sensing technology for early monitoring and mitigation of catastrophic damages.

I completed my Bachelor's (BSc) and first Master's (course-based) degrees in Geography and Environment at Jagannath University, Bangladesh. Before starting my MSc at the University of Calgary, I worked as a research assistant at Curtin University (Australia) on the 'Urban Warming in Dhaka City' project and as a research officer at the Environment and Population Research Center (EPRC, Bangladesh).

In my free time, I enjoy thinking of new ideas, reading, and writing. I write fiction stories for children under the pen name 'Humayun Hanif.' I also have a passion for traveling and photography, with a particular love for the natural beauty of jungle mountains.
