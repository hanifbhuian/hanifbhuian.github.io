Abstract
<br>
The goal of this study is to critically review the existing UHI research and depict the actual scenario of UHI intensity (UHII) in the major cities of Bangladesh. It also provided in-depth knowledge about the materials and methods as well as the existing lacuna of UHI research. A total of 12 studies were discovered that used Landsat data while only three studies found MODIS products (day and night) to examine the UHI intensity (UHII). There are two different methods observed to calculate the UHII while the mono and the split-window algorithm are separately used for LST extraction. However, the summary of the literature provided that most of the major cities of Bangladesh are experiencing the highest rate of UHI intensity particularly Dhaka and Chattogram with 5 ˚C and 3 ˚C from the core city while a study showed the contradicted result as the lowest (1.46 ˚C) for Dhaka and highest (10 ˚C) for Mymensingh. This study also detected the major UHI influencing factors and significant research gaps that play the greatest role to raised UHII. This study will support by providing comprehensive knowledge about the cavities in existing UHI research which aids to evaluate the future UHI study in Bangladesh.
