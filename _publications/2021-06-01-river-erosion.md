Abstract
<br>
The study examines the pattern of riverbank erosion and its effects on the socioeconomic condition of the inhabitants of Islampur upazila in Jamalpur district. Riverbank erosion is a regular event in Jamalpur district, particularly in Islampur upazila because this area is more prone to erosion and many people have already lost their agricultural land, homesteads and other important structures to the river or face imminent erosion. The affected people displaced their place of origin and migrated to a new area where they faced a crisis of basic needs, occupation and security. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were followed in this study. Data were accumulated from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data were collected from questionnaire survey and focus group discussion (FGD) and secondary data were collected from different sources of published and unpublished documents. Three satellite images (Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM and 8 OLI TIRS) and ArcGIS 10 software were used to analyze the pattern of riverbank erosion. Satellite-based monitoring reveals that the deposition rate is higher than the erosion rate in this area during the 1997 to 2017 study period. The study also revealed that the multiple shifting of livelihood of affected people quickly goes under the poverty line and simultaneously their living status also changed. Therefore, this research is an attempt to identify the pattern of riverbank erosion and related problems in the study area and to draw attention of the authority for proper actions and measures.
