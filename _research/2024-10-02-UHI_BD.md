  <!-- Project Description -->
  <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0 20px;">
    The "Urban Warming in Dhaka Megacity" project, conducted from 2019 to 2022 by Curtin University, Australia, aimed to assess the impacts of urban warming in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Supervised by Dr. Ashraf Dewan, this pioneering study deployed over 50 mini weather stations, including 15 larger stations, to collect extensive meteorological data. Additionally, meteorological and object temperature data were gathered through surveying six different regions: residential (both planned and unplanned), traditional areas, parks, educational institutions, and old built-up areas. The collected data encompassed more than 15 parameters, such as air temperature, object temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, WBGT, light emission, and air quality. By analyzing this data, the project sought to understand the urban heat island (UHI) effects and their implications for the outdoor environment in Dhaka. This research was significant as it represented the first systematic evaluation of urban warming and UHI impacts in the region, providing valuable insights for urban planning and public health strategies in rapidly growing megacities like Dhaka.
