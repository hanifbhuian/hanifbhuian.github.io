  <!-- Project Description -->
  <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Microclimatic variations within urban areas significantly affect the natural environment and human health, often surpassing the limits of sustainable living. This study aims to analyze the microclimatic conditions of four distinct locations within Dhaka city with their causes and impacts on the environment. The research is based on both primary and secondary data, employing digital weather monitoring tools, ArcGIS, and Google Earth Pro for data collection. The highest mean temperature was recorded in the Central Business District of Motijheel at 34.6°C, with a 4°C difference between the average monthly highest and lowest temperatures. The maximum mean relative humidity, 91%, was observed in the Agargaon zone during morning hours. Hatirjheel lakefront had the highest average wind speed, reaching 11 km/h at noon. A strong negative correlation was found between temperature and relative humidity (r = -0.833), while relative humidity and wind speed showed a weak positive correlation (r = 0.281). The methods and findings from this study could serve as a valuable foundation for future research on microclimatic variations in other urban areas or cities.
