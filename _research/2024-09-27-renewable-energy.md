The project (2017–2019), funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology and University Grant Commission, Bangladesh, aimed to assess the environmental and economic impacts of solar PV systems in off-grid areas where electricity was not available. It evaluated the potential of solar energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy sustainability in these regions. The economic analysis focused on the cost-effectiveness of solar PV systems, including installation costs, operational benefits, and long-term savings for rural communities. The project highlighted solar PV's critical role in providing clean energy access and supporting Bangladesh’s transition to renewable energy sources.
