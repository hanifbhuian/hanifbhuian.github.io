<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am currently pursuing an MSc (thesis-based) in Geomatics Engineering at the University of Calgary, supported by a full funding award. Alongside my studies, I serve as a graduate research assistant in the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/labs/eoe-lab" target="_blank">Earth Observation for Environment Laboratory</a>.).

My research focuses on early forest fire monitoring using satellite-derived active fire data in Canada, particularly in Alberta and the Northwest Territories. I am interested in geospatial analysis related to natural hazards, forest fires, weather and climate, and urban heat islands (UHI), utilizing GIS and remote sensing (RS) technology. I have published several articles in peer-reviewed journals, including Nature, Sustainable Cities and Societies, International Journal of Climatology, and Fire Journal.

I am proficient in various software and programming tools, including Python, Google Earth Engine, MATLAB, ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ERDAS Imagine, and ENVI. My long-term goal is to specialize in natural hazards, particularly forest fires, by leveraging satellite-based remote sensing technology for early monitoring and mitigation.

In my leisure time, I enjoy brainstorming new ideas, reading, and writing fiction for children under the pen name 'Humayun Hanif.' I also have a passion for travel and photography, especially appreciating the natural beauty of jungle mountains.
