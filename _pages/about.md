<p style="text-align: justify;">
I hold an MSc in Geomatics Engineering from the University of Calgary, specializing in Geodesy, Remote Sensing, and Earth Observation. My MSc research (thesis) focused on early forest fire monitoring and model development using satellite-derived active fire data in Canada, particularly in Alberta and the Northwest Territories. I have a strong interest in geospatial analysis and mapping related to natural hazards, forest fires, weather and climate, and urban heat islands (UHI), utilizing GIS and remote sensing technology.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I have published several research articles in peer-reviewed journals, including Nature, Sustainable Cities and Societies, International Journal of Climatology, and Fire Journal. Throughout my studies, I worked as a graduate research assistant in the Earth Observation for Environment Laboratory, gaining hands-on experience in geospatial data analysis and satellite remote sensing. I have also over 4 years of professional work experience in several national and international organizations.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am proficient in various software and programming tools, including Python (with geospatial libraries such as Arcpy and Geopandas), Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ERDAS Imagine, and ENVI. My long-term goal is to specialize in GIScience, focusing on Earth observation and the environment, including natural hazards—particularly forest fires—by leveraging satellite-based remote sensing technology for early monitoring and mitigation.

In my leisure time, I enjoy brainstorming new ideas, reading, and writing fiction for children under the pen name Humayun Hanif. I also have a passion for travel and photography, especially appreciating the natural beauty of jungle mountains.
